## AAA Titles

### Cyberpunk 2077

| Settings | FPS | Notes |
|----------|-----|-------|
| 1080p High + FSR, no RT | 70–90 | elektricM docs |
| 1080p High + FSR + RT (lighting only) | 50–60 | elektricM docs |
| 1080p Ultra + FSR3.1 | 100+ | elektricM docs |
| 1080p CPU-bound areas | <60 even at lowest (attribution pending) | CPU bottleneck in dense areas — "heavily CPU bound, graphic settings do not matter" (hecto_77113, 09/07/2026) |
| Power draw | Up to 235W | Most demanding game in the library (elektricM docs) |

**Benchmark scores:**
- Stock (2000 MHz, 1000 mV): **57.66 FPS** — elektricM docs
- OC (2230 MHz, 1035 mV): **60.82 FPS** — elektricM docs
- With `mitigations=off`: **+18 FPS** boost — elektricM docs
- **38 CU, 2270 MHz GPU, 4050 MHz CPU, 1975 MT Memory, Ultra no FSR: min FPS >60** — dznuts (May 2026). Matched RTX 3060 performance level. Memory OC gave **+18.4% min FPS boost**.

**6-core vs 8-core unlock (40 CU, 1900 MHz GPU @ 880 mV, 3900 MHz CPU @ 1150 mV, FHD, _kierownik, 30/07/2026):**

| Settings | 6-core FPS | 8-core FPS | Gain |
|----------|-----------|-----------|------|
| Low, no upscale | 80 (170W) | 89 (180W) | +11% |
| Low, FSR2 | 85 (160W) | 93 (173W) | +9% |
| Low, FSR3 | 83 (160W) | 93 (162W) | +12% |
| Medium, no upscale | 72 (178W) | 76 (187W) | +6% |
| Medium, FSR2 | 79 (170W) | 90 (178W) | +14% |
| High, no upscale | 63 (180W) | 66 (189W) | +5% |
| High, FSR2 | 73 (170W) | 80 (180W) | +10% |
| Ultra, no upscale | 55 (180W) | 58 (189W) | +5% |
| Ultra, FSR2 | 63 (175W) | 70 (185W) | +11% |
| Ultra, FSR3 | 64 (175W) | 70 (184W) | +9% |

8 cores give a consistent **+5-14% FPS** in Cyberpunk with ~8-10W higher power draw. See [02-BIOS & Firmware](02-bios-and-firmware.md) for core unlock methods.

**8-core 40CU Cyberpunk results (Jul 30 2026):**

| User | Config | Settings | FPS | Notes |
|------|--------|----------|-----|-------|
| dbkretro | 8 core + 40 CU | 1080p | ~60 | Up from ~52 with 6 core — "8 core 40cu gang" |
| qwert9811 | 8 core unlocked | Dogtown (CPU-heavy area) | Early 50s | Up from early 40s — ~10 FPS gain in most demanding area |

**Optimized FSR 4 RADV build (rescuemei/dmoraza, Aug 14 2026):** a community-patched RADV (Mesa 26.1.6 base) optimizing the FSR 4.1.1 INT8 fallback with i24 arithmetic reaches **~82–85 FPS vs ~70–75 with the previous "Golden" build** in a high-FPS test scene — shader dropped from 64k → 37k instructions ([github.com/dmorazasanchez/bc250-fsr4](https://github.com/dmorazasanchez/bc250-fsr4)). See [11-community-and-resources](11-community-and-resources.md).

**FSR4 vs XeSS vs FSR2/3 RT comparison (Aug 2026):** in RT Low tests (game unspecified), native = 56 FPS, FSR2/3 Quality = 75 FPS, FSR4 = 73 FPS, XeSS Balanced = 78 FPS. XeSS balanced outperforms both FSR2 and FSR4 in RT but image quality is worse. FSR4 balanced/performance is preferred for solid 60 FPS with frame generation, though input latency equals base FPS (e.g. FG from 30→60 has 30 FPS latency). Async compute patch alone gave ~10 FPS uplift (70→80 native) (dmoraza, community, Aug 2026).

**Tips:** Enable FSR Quality for a significant boost. DLSS/FSR Frame Generation works well. (elektricM docs)

**Sep 2026 benchmarks (40 CU, 8 cores):**
- Default High, 40 CU, 8 cores @ 2000 MHz (Bazzite) — baseline before tweaks (dbkretro, 06/09/2026) [confirmed: @dbkretro, 06/09/2026]
- Default High, 36 CU @ 2 GHz, 8 cores @ 3.85 GHz (Bazzite) — comparable (capt.cat_13, 06/09/2026)
- **1080p High (RT off) + FSR3 Native AA + FG 3.1:** **90–110 FPS** on 40 CU @ 2000 MHz (peak 1850 due to governor), 3.7 GHz CPU, 6 cores, stock pads/paste, 2x front +1 back P12 Pro — without case (halil_iboo, 06/09/2026). With `mitigations=off` + unlocked frame cap: **85 FPS** rock-solid 60 with cap re-enabled, no frame drops (dbkretro, 07/09/2026) [confirmed: @dbkretro, 07/09/2026].

### Hogwarts Legacy

| Settings | FPS | Notes |
|----------|-----|-------|
| 1080p Medium | ~60 (nexgen3d, 26/12/2025) | Needs zswap or zram enabled (16 GB RAM is tight) |
| With FSR4 on Proton GE | Playable [confirmed: @lonewolf05849, 16/01/2026]
| 4K, 60 FPS | Playable | "Playing Hogwarts at 4k 60fps on the bc250" [confirmed: @cubehacker8107, 19/08/2026] — settings not shared |

> Game needs ~16.5 GB RAM. Enable zswap + swapfile (preferred) or zram (`zram-size = ram x 0.75`) and close background apps — see [05-OS Installation → Memory Configuration](05-os-installation.md#memory-configuration-zswap-vs-zram) (zram note: hojnikb, 08/03/2026; zswap preferred: pops1cl/essdee4336, 23/06/2026).
> Use 6 GB static VRAM allocation to avoid OOM crashes. [confirmed: @big_trov, 28/02/2026]

### Red Dead Redemption 2

| Settings | FPS | Notes |
|----------|-----|-------|
| Full graphics (DX11) | Smooth (45+ FPS min — elektricM docs) | Heatsink barely warm with 120mm fan |
| 2230 MHz GPU | Crashes (i_guess_im_a_girl, 20/11/2025) | Reduce to 2150 MHz for stability (i_guess_im_a_girl, 20/11/2025) |
| 10/6 VRAM split | Fixed crash | Static allocation avoids ZRAM conflicts [confirmed: @xseol, 12/07/2025] |

**Launch flag:** `-useMaximumSettings` — elektricM docs
**Adapter fix:** May detect as software rendering — change adapter in graphics settings to match `vulkaninfo --summary` output (elektricM docs)
**Temps:** ~75C during gameplay. [confirmed: @.strykur, 15/01/2026]

**8-core 40CU RDR2 (dbkretro, Jul 30 2026):** 1080p, decent quality settings — near 60 FPS with main dip during snow scenes. GPU bound in most scenarios but less stutter in city areas with extra cores.

**8-core 38CU RDR2 benchmark (sho.ta, Aug 13 2026):** ~65 FPS in benchmark, 55–85 real FPS, High-Ultra 1080p on Bazzite with **0.5/15.5 memory split** (38 CU @ 1900 MHz 900 mV, 8 cores @ 3.85 GHz 1150 mV). "Timegraph is smooth most of the time" — FPS drops significantly in Saint Denis (~40–45 FPS) with spiky timegraph due to poor CPU performance.

**Sep 2026 update (38 CU, 8 cores, 2000 MHz, 3.9 GHz):** 1080p Ultra **70–80 FPS** at 67–70 °C after 1h without crash, MangoHud overlay ~70 FPS average; benchmark peak ~70–80 FPS under 70 °C (shibly_91236, 04/09/2026 and 07/09/2026, Proton GE) [confirmed: @shibly_91236, 04/09/2026].

### Spider-Man 2

| Settings | FPS | Notes |
|----------|-----|-------|
| Medium, 6 GB VRAM | ~60 | GPU/CPU around 65C | [confirmed: community reports]
| 1080p native AA, Medium | 55–60 | Textures Medium, rest Low |
| 1440p FSR3 Quality | ~55–60 | Similar to 1080p native | [confirmed: @nexgen3d, 09/12/2025]
| Auto VRAM | Crashes after 5–10 min | Must use 6 GB+ static allocation | [confirmed: @bigmedi, 02/05/2026]

**Fix:** Add kernel params: `ttm.pages_limit=3959290 ttm.page_pool_size=3959290`

### Elden Ring

| Settings | FPS | Notes |
|----------|-----|-------|
| Any settings | 45–50 (mzk10, 06/11/2025: "hangs around 45fps... nothing gets it above 50fps") | CPU-bound — elektricM docs report expected 60 FPS with settings adjustments |
| 4K | 30–40 | Playable but choppy | [confirmed: @imeden, 09/12/2025]

> Changing resolution/settings may not help.
> Fix skybox artifacts: `RADV_DEBUG=nohiz` in Steam launch options.

**8-core GPU unlock boost (glide_2026, Aug 3 2026):** Temporary unlock of extra cores gave **~10 more FPS** ("definitely added 10ish frames"), though still fluctuates around 60 — gains are CPU-dependent and vary by scene.

### The Crew Motorfest

| Settings | FPS | Notes |
|----------|-----|-------|
| 1080p High | 60 capped | GPU OC 2100 MHz, CachyOS with Proton-Cachy |

### Borderlands 3

| Settings | FPS | Notes |
|----------|-----|-------|
| 1080p Medium, 8x AA | ~62 | Eden-6 benchmark (whomstdv, 26/11/2025); inventory has black box background (cosmetic only) |
| 1080p Ultra, 2 GHz OC | 68 → 82 | OC uplift (.warlocksyno, 25/05/2026) |
| Default (low/medium mix) | ~60 | (selectivelygood_16010, 27/11/2025) |

### Starfield (vvaaron, Dec 2025 - Jan 2026)

| Settings | FPS | Notes |
|----------|-----|-------|
| 1080p Medium | 48–60 | 60 FPS capped with frame gen |
| 1080p High | 39–60 | FG: 58–60 FPS |
| 1080p Ultra | 35–60 | FG: 58–60 FPS, temps 64C max |
| 1080p Medium (New Atlantis) | 48–53 | Most demanding location |

> vvaaron (08/12/2025): "playing Starfield at 1080 stock ultra settings. With frame gen enabled (gpu intensive). Getting a really good experience at a capped 60fps"; (06/01/2026): "holds a stable 60fps on ultra with frame gen (although a slightly nicer experience at mid-high without frame gen)". GPU OC 1000–2220 MHz, P12 Pro fan.

### Alan Wake 2

| Settings | FPS | Notes |
|----------|-----|-------|
| 1080p | ~100 with FG | Reported playable, frame gen recommended | [confirmed: @chiribayashepherd, 10/06/2026]

## Shooters & Action

### Doom Eternal

| Settings | FPS | Notes |
|----------|-----|-------|
| Ultra (not max VRAM) | 100 | Loves Vulkan | [confirmed: @spitko, 03/02/2025]
| 512 MB VRAM | Heavy stuttering | Needs higher VRAM allocation | [confirmed: @fforduck, 02/05/2026]

### Doom: The Dark Ages (Update 2+)

| Settings | FPS | Notes |
|----------|-----|-------|
| Low / Handheld preset, 1080p, FSR Quality | ~60 | GPU 2230 MHz, CPU stock |

**Fix:** VRS crash — use [Vulkan_NullVRS](https://github.com/bangstk/Vulkan_NullVRS) layer (bangstk, May 2026).

### Crimson Desert

| Settings | FPS | Notes |
|----------|-----|-------|
| 1080p Medium, no scaling | 38–42 | |
| Ultra (textures High), 4K + FG | ~60 solid | Open world with fast-flight mod; drops in dense towns [confirmed: @dmoraza, 14/08/2026] |

**Fix:** Use Proton Experimental Bleeding-Edge branch with VKD3D RDNA1 fix. Version 1.02 works. [confirmed: @nohanmv, 01/04/2026]

> The **v1.18.00 game update broke launch on Proton 11** for some users; `proton-cachy` and Proton Experimental work (.crotch, 19/08/2026). VRAM split: fixed 3–4 GB works best — games detect 6 GB and can use up to 8 GB; forcing 6 GB static broke some games, and dynamic 512 MB loads lowest-quality textures in this title (@cubehacker8107, @h00man._., @_mastag, Aug 16 2026).
> At 38–40 CU: ~55 FPS FHD no scaling — +10–15 FPS over 24 CU (pijuli.); CPU-limited in some areas (vfxmz).

### Space Marine 2

| Settings | FPS | Notes |
|----------|-----|-------|
| 8 cores unlocked | ~2x vs 6 cores | smcelrea, Aug 10 2026 — "almost double the perf in space marine 2, in the rippers section of the campaign, with 8 cores unlocked" |

> Severely CPU-bound on this board; the 8-core unlock is the single biggest win for this title.

### Pragmata

| Settings | FPS | Notes |
|----------|-----|-------|
| 8 cores + governor tweaks | High | lovelifetrustfaith, Aug 10 2026 — "pragmata ran pretty good before the cpu core unlock and additional tweakings"; later "pragmata now on stock governor values, just insane..." |

> First launched unreliably ("For some weird reason it won't start") — resolved after additional tweaks from MastaG's GitHub (see [11-community-and-resources](11-community-and-resources.md)).

### Death Stranding 2

| Settings | FPS | Notes |
|----------|-----|-------|
| 36 CU, ultrawide 1440p High + frame gen | 60 locked | dartzon, CachyOS, Thermalright PA120, GPU backplate cooler, <72C |
| 36 CU, 1440p High, no frame gen | Dips under 60 | CPU bottleneck (dartzon) |
| 1080p Low, FSR 3.1.5 | ~60 dips to 45 | CPU limited |

**PICO upscaler:** PlayStation's FSR equivalent was ported to PC as "PICO" — works on Decima engine games (Horizon, Death Stranding). User reports it's superior to AMD FSR3 (dartzon, May 2026).

**Cooling:** dartzon used Thermalright Peerless Assassin 120 + GPU backplate cooler with fans for VRAM chips. Temps never exceeded 72C with 36 CU unlocked.

### Monster Hunter Wilds

| Settings | FPS | Notes |
|----------|-----|-------|
| 1080p Medium | +12% with `mitigations=off` | |

**Fix:** `sudo rpm-ostree kargs --append='mitigations=off'` [confirmed: @filippor, 09/12/2025]

### Doom 2016

| Settings | FPS | Notes |
|----------|-----|-------|

### Forza Horizon 6 [Discord user, May 2026]

| Settings | FPS | Notes |
|----------|-----|-------|
| 1080p High + FSR 3.1.5 | 40–60 | Preset High, FSR helped fix pixelated textures |
| Proton (CachyOS) | Playable | Low memory warning after prologue — try 512MB split + zswap (antmagl, jeffr7814); menu FPS drops to 15 (capt.cat_13) |

### Genshin Impact

| Settings | FPS | Notes |
|----------|-----|-------|

## Performance Optimization Tips

1. **1080p is the sweet spot** — 1440p works with FSR, 4K only for older titles (elektricM docs)
2. **CPU is the main bottleneck** in most modern games (GDDR6 shared memory latency) [confirmed: @corbanitevevo, 08/12/2025]
3. **VRAM: 4 GB for most games, 6 GB for demanding AAA titles** (elektricM docs: 4 GB recommended; 6 GB from community)
4. **Use FSR** for free performance boost (elektricM docs)
5. **Update to Mesa 26.x+** for best compatibility and performance (elektricM docs)
6. **Try Proton-GE** for better compatibility (elektricM docs)
7. **Kernel 6.19.x** for VRR and DP audio fixes (gennro); 6.18 LTS as stable fallback
8. **Mesa 26.x recommended** — significant RT and performance improvements; 25.1+ minimum
9. **`mitigations=off`** gives ~10–15% FPS boost in CPU-bound games (elektricM docs: "mitigations=off for +10-15% FPS")
10. **Keep GPU under 85C** for long-term stability (elektricM docs)
11. **Disable Handheld Daemon** if using Bazzite for gaming (elektricM docs):
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl disable --now hhd && sudo systemctl mask hhd
    ```
12. **CachyOS may be ~5–10% faster** than Bazzite in raw benchmarks [confirmed: @.captainwasabi, 23/05/2026]
13. **40 CU unlock: more CUs at lower clocks** match higher clocks at stock 24 CU — cooler and less power (big_trov: 40 CU at 1200 MHz = 60 FPS at 73C, 30W less than 24 CU at 2000 MHz achieving same FPS). See [02-BIOS](02-bios-and-firmware.md).

40 CU Extreme already surpasses the 24 CU record (4713) by 22%+ at lower clocks (2300 vs 2530 MHz). Theoretically should reach ~6500+ at equivalent clocks. More scores expected as community adopts the unlock. Post your results in the Discord `#benchmarks` channel.

**Aug 2026 updates:** big_trov confirmed the current record is "5800 or so" (Aug 12 2026). pm_me_kitsunemimi hit 5320 @ 2250 MHz GPU / 4 GHz CPU on Bazzite with 8 cores unlocked — "Not sure what the average score is but 5320 is good" (rocksalt_, Aug 12 2026), max temps "76 max iirc". mitchthepreacher reached 5150 after a CachyOS update with no unlock/OC changes, in a Redux case, "Temps are 75 but its a jet engine" (Aug 13 2026).

**Sep 2026 updates:** vvaaron averaging ~4900 at 2300 MHz GPU / 4.0 GHz CPU on full 40 CU + 8 cores, Bazzite (08/09/2026); expected score at 2300 MHz is ~5700 — "plenty of people cant get much past 2200 MHz" and VRMs shut off with reset button dead (big_trov, 08/09/2026) [confirmed: @vvaaron, 08/09/2026]. dbkretro 40 CU 8c @ 2000 MHz 960 mV Bazzite stock clocks/paste (06/09/2026); .lordantares 2230 MHz @ 1030 mV on Mesa 26.2 / CachyOS 7.2.2 (06–07/09/2026), noting 2300 MHz artifacts unless fans 100% and >70 °C triggers black screen [confirmed: @.lordantares, 07/09/2026]. nhoj0176 record **2350 MHz @ 1000 mV** (2500 MHz CPU @ 800 mV) — temps 66 °C at 2100 MHz, 60 °C at 1900 MHz in Superposition; Bykski Icedragon fan, PTM7950 die + thermal putty front, 2.0 mm pads on VRAM (12–13/09/2026) [confirmed: @nhoj0176, 12/09/2026].

**38 CU = 36 CU (Aug 12 2026):** a "38 CU" config is effectively 36 CU — the Shader Engines (SE0/SE1) must have symmetric WGP counts. fforduck: "You have 36 unlocked 😉 SE0 and SE01 need the same amount. If you have disabled one in SE0 it will automatically disable one in SE1" — and per hashtagoctothorp, disabling another WGP in SE1 gives the *same* score. The only meaningful CU counts are 24/28/32/36/40 (counting full pairs); the dznuts "38 CU" runs above are the same silicon configuration as 36 CU.

**Max clock findings:** 2400 MHz at 40 CU causes hard OCP lockup requiring power cable pull (reset/power buttons unresponsive) across multiple boards (big_trov, codyrainy, cralant). 2100-2300 MHz is the stable range for most boards. Trimming CUs for higher clocks is not advantageous: big_trov's 32CU @ 2400 MHz scored worse than 40CU @ 2300 MHz, with similar power draw (~270W).

**38 CU voltage findings (May 2026):** 38 CU at 2200 MHz requires ~1050-1060 mV (dznuts). 1085 mV not enough for 2230 MHz with 38 CU. At 2200 MHz, 995 mV is stable for some boards (codyrainy). Power limit and voltage ceiling intersect at ~2200 MHz for most boards, creating a hard stability ceiling.

**Memory OC (May 2026):** dznuts tested memory OC at 1975 MHz CL26 using RobinMemTiming. Only +80 points in Superposition and +1 FPS in Cyberpunk — not worth the instability risk. Memory OC causes 1-in-20 boot failures (no POST).

> **Efficiency insight (big_trov):** More CUs at lower clocks match the performance of fewer CUs at higher clocks, at lower temperature and power. 40 CU @ 1200 MHz = 60 FPS (73C, 30W less than 24 CU @ 2000 MHz achieving same FPS).
> **OCP hard lockup (big_trov, codyrainy, cralant):** 2400 MHz at 40 CU causes hard lockup where reset and power buttons do nothing -- requires pulling power cable. Likely Over Current Protection triggering. Consistent across multiple boards regardless of cooling. One user with AIO reported 2400 MHz stable at 1120 mV.
> **CPU OC affects GPU stability (big_trov, hojnikb):** Increasing CPU from 3500 to 4000 MHz lowered the GPU voltage threshold for hard lockup. Total system power draw matters -- undervolt CPU when pushing GPU limits.
> **Game-specific instability (May 2026):** RE4 Remake crashes even with stable stress tests (nataliezaki, May 21 2026). Games need more voltage on GPU than synthetic benchmarks to be stable. If benchmarks pass but games crash, increase voltage by 10-15 mV.
> **Voltage wall at 40 CU (big_trov, May 2026):** Two limit curves govern 40 CU stability -- a voltage ceiling and a power limit. These curves intersect at approximately 2200 MHz, creating a hard stability ceiling. Above this point, diminishing returns are severe regardless of cooling. Power consumption: ~250W from wall during gaming, ~350W during Furmark at 40 CU (bytepond, May 2026).
> **Hard limit:** 2300 MHz at 40 CU = ~288W. Stay at or below 2200 MHz for safety with 40 CU.
